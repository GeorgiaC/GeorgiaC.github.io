<p>Hi! I am a hardware-focused robotics engineer passionate about sustainability, equity, and the potential of new technologies on and off planet Earth.</p>

<p>I wear many hats and love to work across disciplines.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked in bike share, space robotics, and 3D printed construction. I bike, build, and joke on and off the clock.</p>
