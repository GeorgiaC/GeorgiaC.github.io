Hi! I am a hardware-focused robotics engineer passionate about sustainability, equity, and the potential of new technologies on and off planet Earth. 

I wear many hats and love to work across disciplines.

I've worked in bike share, space robotics, and 3D printed construction. I bike, build, and joke on and off the clock.
