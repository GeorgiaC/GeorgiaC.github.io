# Cornell Mars Rover

As an engineering student, I helped to build the first three rovers for Cornell's Mars Rover project team, first as a member of the tasks sub-system, then as the team system's engineer, and finally as the team lead. As the team lead, I guided a group of over 40 students divided into six sub-stystems (tasks, drive-train, electrical, software, science, and business) to build that year's rover, Ares, and compete in the University Rover Challenge in Utah.
