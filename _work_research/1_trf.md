# The Reclamation Factory

I'm the founder and a robotics engineer at the Pittsburgh based robotics startup, The Reclamation Factory. 

We're building automated hardware for communities that transforms plastic trash into usable manufacturing source material. See the work we're doing and support our mission  <a href="https://www.thereclamationfactory.com/"> here! </a>
