# Sunn, Inc/Cornell University Sustainable Design

As a mechanical engineer on the Cornell University Sustainable Design team, I helped design and manufacture a luminaire and portable housing structure for the Sunn light - a person and eco-friendly lighting alternative that uses fiber optic lightpipes to bring natural sunlight into window-less rooms, and suplements that light with color a tempurature-matched LED array. We presented at conventions, trade-shows, and the 2013 P3 Design Competition for Sustainability hosted by the EPA on the National Mall.

# Cornell's Rapid Prototyping Lab

In 2013, I co-founded and operated Cornell's first student-use Rapid Prototyping Lab, which is still in operation today!
