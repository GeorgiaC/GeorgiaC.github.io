# Reclamation Factory

I'm the founder and a robotics engineer at the Pittsburgh based robotics startup, Reclamation Factory. 

We're building automated hardware and machine learning systems that transforms plastic waste into valuable manufacturing source material. See the work we're doing and support our mission  <a href="https://www.reclamationfactory.com/"> here! </a>
