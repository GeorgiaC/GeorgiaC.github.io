# Social Bicycles

Social Bicycles (later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_(transportation_company)"> JUMP </a>, purchased by Uber in 2018) designed, operated, and manufactured bicycles, street furnature, and point-of-sale kiosks for public bike share systems in dozens of cities accross 10 countries. 

As the mechanical engineer, I designed hardware for bikes, e-bikes, and PoS kiosks, and managed the kiosk project.
