# Tensegrital Wheel for Advanced Lunar Surface Mobility

At <a href="https://protoinnovations.com/">ProtoInnovations</a>, I worked on designing novel wheels with the goals of increasing compliance. Because traditional rubber wheels degrade under the high radiation and low tempurature lunar environments, my challenge was to develop this complaince using only metal components. You can learn more about my research and testing process in my published papers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jterra.2021.11.008"> here </a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jterra.2021.11.007"> here. </a>

I also helped develop a testing platform to test the wheels of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/artemis-moon-rover-s-wheels-are-ready-to-roll"> VIPER mooon rover </a>, which will head to the moon as part of the Artemis mission.
